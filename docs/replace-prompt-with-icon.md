Prompting for possible values of fields (also known as drilling down on a user interface) is very common.

There are several ways to enhance a Page with this functionality, such as using drop-down lists. In this Guide we will assume we want to keep the Window record feature of the legacy DDS and pop-up records on the screen to present valid field values.

The legacy application used to present a constant label — to the right of the given field —  with the content “(F4)” to hint to the user that pressing Function 4 on the keyboard at specific fields would present the list of valid values.

In particular, the SunFarm Application menu option “Update” on the main Page would show the “Customer Maintenance” screen — which we have been enhancing in during the narrative of this Guide —. 

The Customer Maintenance Page contains two Prompts:

1. Prompting for States (to update Address Information) and
2. Prompting for Status (to update Customer Status)
