*ASNA Monarch Nomad&reg;* provides a collection of *Icon Shapes* in the form of [SVG Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) with commonly used shapes that are inspired by the [Font Awesome free library](https://fontawesome.com/plans).

The *Icon Shapes* are simple and clean, monochrome (color can be selected), scaled without loss and respect the background (use *transparent* background).

*ASNA Monarch Nomad&reg;* Icon library contains 250 named shapes, which should be sufficient for most of the DdsButtons you application may need.
