This guide will show basic techniques to change the Look and Feel of *Monarch Nomad&reg; Application Pages* to make them more *appealing*.

During the description of the steps to apply the different techniques, the public repository in GitHub will be used:

## Reference public GitHub repository

[https://github.com/ASNA/SunFarm](https://github.com/ASNA/SunFarm)
   

## Commits to the Repository are used as Milestones

This Guide shows the **git** *Commit Comment* as a reference for the Step completed. The place in the Guide where you should reference the *commit* is presented by a *footnote*.

A footnote such as:
~~~
1 Commit "Navigation menu customization"
~~~

Indicates that it is recommended to locate the comment *Navigation menu customization* in the commit history and compare the code to the previous commit to show the exact code that was affected.

> To simplify localization of commit history, most of the pages that discuss source code changes have a **Quick How-to** table at the top of the page. These are very helpful when using the Guide as a reference, when all you want to do is quickly recall how to code that particular feature.
