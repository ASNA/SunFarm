[In the last section]({{ site.rooturl }}/enhancements-affecting-logic/), we left the *Customer Inquiry* Page, looking like this image:

![Narrower Customer Name Column](/images/narrower-name-column.png)

There comes a time when to continue enhancing a page, it is necessary to change the Business Logic.

Since we have been able to compress the screen while aligning elements and eliminating redundant items, we are left with unused real-estate.

The Business Logic is writing fourteen records at a time, now we can fit at least twenty (a nice rounding number) or even more if the majority of users may have higher resolution devices.

Letâ€™s assume we want to increase the record count from fourteen to twenty.
